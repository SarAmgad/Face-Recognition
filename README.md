# Face Recognition

## Overview
The Face Recognition project serves as the final project for a computer vision course, applying concepts such as computer vision, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and Qt to develop a desktop application capable of recognizing faces. The data files included in the repository are specific to the project team.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect faces within images or live video streams.
- **Face Recognition:** Implements PCA-based face recognition algorithms to identify individuals.
- **User Interface:** Built using the Qt framework, offering a user-friendly desktop application experience.
- **Image Processing:** Includes functionality for preprocessing images to enhance face recognition accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision:** Utilized to detect and recognize faces within images or video streams.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in face recognition.
- **Qt:** Used to develop the desktop application's graphical user interface.

## Installation
To run the Face Recognition application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Build and run the application using Qt Creator or the command line.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Choose an image or video file containing faces, or use the webcam option for live face detection.
3. Perform face detection and recognition using the provided controls.
4. Explore additional features and functionalities within the application's interface.

## Data Files
The data files included in the repository are specific to the project team and are used for testing and training the face recognition algorithms.
