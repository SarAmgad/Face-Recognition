# Face Recognition

## Overview
The Face Recognition project serves as the final project for a computer vision course, applying concepts such as computer vision, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and Qt to develop a desktop application capable of recognizing faces. The data files included in the repository are specific to the project team.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect faces within images or live video streams.
- **Face Recognition:** Implements PCA-based face recognition algorithms to identify individuals.
- **User Interface:** Built using the Qt framework, offering a user-friendly desktop application experience.
- **Image Processing:** Includes functionality for preprocessing images to enhance face recognition accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision:** Utilized to detect and recognize faces within images or video streams.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Employed for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction in face recognition.
- **Qt:** Used to develop the desktop application's graphical user interface.

## Data Files
The data files included in the repository are specific to the project team and are used for testing and training the face recognition algorithms.
